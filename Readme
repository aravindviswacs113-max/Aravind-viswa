My Personal Portfolio ðŸš€
Author: Aravind Viswa

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website showcases my projects and provides a way to learn more about me. It's a playground for me to experiment and share what I'm learning.

About
This portfolio is my very first website, built as part of my journey as a 1st Year B.Tech student. It's designed to be simple, fun, and easy to navigate. I'm still learning and exploring new technologies, and this portfolio reflects that process. I love coding, gaming, and coffee, and my portfolio is a reflection of these passions.

Technologies Used
The website is primarily built using foundational web technologies:

HTML: For the structure and content.

CSS: For styling and layout.

JavaScript (JS): Used in one of the projects ("Rock Paper Scissors") for interactive functionality.

Projects
Here's a list of the projects featured on this portfolio:

Squad Site: A fun intro site for my friends. Built with HTML and CSS.

Rock Paper Scissors: A classic game to play with friends, demonstrating basic JavaScript skills.

Mini Website: My very first mini website, which helped me learn the basics of HTML and CSS.
